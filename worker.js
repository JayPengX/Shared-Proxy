// ---- worker.js ----
// A single Cloudflare Worker serving three sibling static sites' optional
// server-side features (Orbit Class, Orbit Vocab, Match Find) - AI (Gemini)
// features and cross-device sync - kept in this dedicated repo rather than
// inside any one of those three, because it was never really "Orbit's own"
// infrastructure to begin with; see README.md for what each route does, who
// consumes it, and one-time deploy/setup instructions. Routed by path:
//
//   POST      /gemini     - AI schedule-photo import (see src/gemini-ocr.js).
//                            Holds the real Gemini API key server-side so
//                            end users never need one of their own.
//   POST      /nl-edit    - Orbit's natural-language schedule edits (see
//                            src/editor-nl-edit.js). Same key as /gemini.
//   GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /sync - Orbit's own cross-device schedule sync
//                            (see src/sync.js).
//   GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /vocab-sync - Orbit Vocab's cross-device
//                            progress sync (see that repo's sync.js). This
//                            Worker is simply reused as shared
//                            infrastructure so that app doesn't need a
//                            second Worker, Firebase project, or set of
//                            rate-limit tuning. See "==== /sync" below for
//                            how the two differ.
//   POST      /vocab-ai   - Orbit Vocab's live, per-learner AI mnemonics
//                            (see that repo's vocab-ai.js). Same reuse
//                            reasoning as /vocab-sync, but shares /gemini's
//                            GEMINI_API_KEY - see "==== /vocab-ai" below.
//
// Match Find's /sports-proxy lives in its own Worker (sports-proxy-worker.js)
// because this one's [placement] region pin (needed for Gemini) applies to
// the whole script - see that file's top comment. Match Find makes no AI
// calls at all.
//
// /sync and /vocab-sync both hold a Firebase service-account key
// server-side and proxy Firestore, so the pairing code isn't the only thing
// standing between the internet and that Firestore project. DELETE wipes
// the shared document outright on either path (see orbitSyncDeleteForEveryone
// and its vocab-sync equivalent).
//
// Combined into one file/one deployment purely for setup convenience - one
// Worker, one KV binding, one set of secrets to manage - not for any
// technical reason: Cloudflare's Workers Free plan daily request cap
// (100,000/day) is per-account, not per-Worker, so splitting these into
// separate Workers never bought any extra headroom in the first place. The
// same reasoning is why /vocab-sync reuses the *same* Firebase project and
// service-account credentials as /sync rather than needing its own - it
// only needs its own Firestore collection (see VOCAB_SYNC_APP below) and
// its own rate-limit counters, both cheap to add to an already-deployed
// Worker.
//
// The routes have very different trust boundaries - the AI routes only
// ever run a fixed server-owned prompt, /sync holds credentials with full
// read/write access to Orbit's own shared documents, /vocab-sync the same
// but for a different app's documents - so each validates and rate-limits its own requests independently (see
// isRateLimited: every call passes its own `feature` key, so a burst
// against one path can never eat into another's quota) and no path touches
// another's secrets or code.
//
// Every feature is entirely optional. Not configuring GEMINI_API_KEY (see
// handleGeminiRequest) or the FIREBASE_* secrets (see handleSyncRequest,
// shared by /sync and /vocab-sync) just makes that path (or both sync
// paths at once, since they share the same Firebase secrets) return a "not
// configured" error - the other features still work normally. See README
// for the one-time setup each needs.

// ---- Bilingual error responses ----------------------------------------
//
// Every error this Worker returns used to be a plain, fixed-language
// `message` string - some written in English, some in Traditional Chinese,
// picked ad hoc by whoever wrote that call site rather than by any
// consistent rule. That made the response impossible for a caller to
// localize (an English-reading Match Find-style consumer would see raw
// Chinese with no way to tell what it meant) and impossible to branch on
// reliably (matching against message text breaks the moment the wording is
// tweaked).
//
// The fix: every error carries a stable, never-translated `code` (for a
// caller that wants to render its own UI string) alongside a `message` that
// is picked at response time from ERROR_MESSAGES based on the request's
// `Accept-Language` header (for a caller that just wants to display
// something reasonable as-is, same as before).
//
// Each language's actual text lives in its own file under locales/ (see
// locales/en.js, locales/zh-TW.js, imported at the top of this file) -
// ERROR_MESSAGES below just zips them together by code, so errorJson() can
// keep doing `ERROR_MESSAGES[code][locale]`. Adding a third language later:
// copy locales/en.js to locales/<code>.js (every code `en` has should exist
// there too), import it above, add one line below, and add a branch to
// pickLocale().
//
// `en` is treated as authoritative for the codes that were already English
// before bilingual support existed (POST_ONLY, INVALID_JSON, etc.) - the
// zh-TW text next to them is a later translation, not a change to English
// callers' behavior. The codes that were already Chinese (RATE_LIMITED,
// DAILY_QUOTA_EXCEEDED, MISSING_API_KEY, INVALID_MNEMONIC) keep their
// original zh-TW wording byte-for-byte, with English added alongside.
const ERROR_MESSAGES = Object.fromEntries(
  Object.keys(en).map((code) => [code, { en: en[code], 'zh-TW': zhTW[code] }])
);

// Defaults to zh-TW whenever the header is absent or doesn't clearly prefer
// English, to preserve current behavior for existing callers (orbit/
// orbit-vocab) that don't send this header today - only a request that
// actually says English first (`en`, `en-US`, `..., en;q=...`, etc.) gets
// English back.

// ERROR_MESSAGES and picks the response language from the request's
// Accept-Language header. The response shape (`{ error: { code, message } }`)
// keeps the pre-existing `message` field so callers that just display
// `error.message` raw keep working unchanged.

// isRateLimitedInMemory, used only as a fallback if the KV binding is
// missing or a KV call errors): Workers run many isolates in parallel
// across Cloudflare's edge, so an in-memory counter resets per isolate and
// a distributed burst of requests can blow straight through it. KV is
// still not a hard security boundary on its own (an abuser can spread
// requests across enough source IPs to dodge a per-IP counter), but it
// closes the specific gap of "just send enough requests to outrun a single
// isolate's memory." The real, unconditional backstop underneath both is

// every single request that wasn't already over its limit - one write just
// to increment the same counter by one - so a single feature under
// ordinary traffic (SYNC_READ_RATE_LIMIT alone allows 6000 requests/hour
// per IP) could burn through the *entire account's* daily write budget in
// minutes, at which point every kv.put() anywhere in this Worker starts
// throwing and every feature silently falls back to isRateLimitedInMemory
// (see the catch in isRateLimited below) - a noisy neighbor on one path
// degrading rate-limit accuracy on all the others.
//
// The fix batches increments per isolate instead of persisting each one to
// KV individually: the authoritative count is read from KV once per window
// (a read, not a write), and further increments in this isolate accumulate
// in memory (pendingCounters) and are flushed as a single write no more
// than once every KV_FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS. The limit check below still runs
// against base+delta on every request, so enforcement stays effectively

// reading a disallowed page's response, but the request itself was always
// fully processed (including the real, billed Gemini call) before that
// browser was ever told no. A direct curl/script call doesn't send or care
// about CORS at all, so every one of these routes was, in practice,
// callable by anyone who simply knew the URL - exactly the exposure a
// public GitHub repo whose client source contains that same URL creates.
//
// GEMINI_BILLED_PATHS makes the check an actual, enforced GATE instead: reject before
// EVER reaching a billed handler if Origin is missing or not in
// ALLOWED_ORIGINS. This costs every real caller nothing - every route this
// applies to is a POST with a JSON body, which browsers always treat as a
// CORS "non-simple" request and always attach a real Origin header to,
// preflight included - so a legitimate call from Orbit/Orbit Vocab's own
// already-working pages is completely unaffected; only a bare
// script/curl call (no Origin at all) or a request from some OTHER site
// embedding a fetch to this Worker (a real Origin, just not an allowed
// one) is newly rejected.
//
// HONEST LIMIT: an Origin header is just text a non-browser client can set
// to whatever it wants - a targeted attacker who reads this file (this is
// a public, open-source repo) can trivially copy the allowed Origin value
// verbatim. This gate stops opportunistic/naive abuse (URL scanners,
// another site's page silently spending your quota through its visitors'
// browsers) and, combined with isDailyGlobalCapped above, hard-bounds the
// worst case even against someone who does spoof it. It is NOT real
// authentication - this app has no user accounts to authenticate, and no
// client-side secret can ever be genuinely secret in a fully public static
// site's own source. Real lock-down would need a backend with real user
// identity, which is a materially bigger change than this route currently
// has any other reason to need.

//
// Single-file, and self-classifying, deliberately: an earlier version split
// this into two separate fixed prompts (a "timetable" one and a
// "registration" one) and had the CLIENT decide, purely from upload order,
// which file went to which - file 1 was always assumed to be the timetable,
// every file after it a registration record. That broke completely the
// moment someone picked the files in the other order: the registration form
// got read as if it were a timetable grid (producing garbage), and the
// actual timetable photo got read as if it were a course list (finding
// nothing to extract). There is no reliable signal in upload order - a file
// picker doesn't know or care what's in the files - so the model has to
// determine this itself instead of trusting how the files arrived. Every
// file now gets exactly this one prompt, and "documentKind" is the model's
// own answer to "what am I looking at", read back by
// src/gemini-ocr.js's recognizeAndMerge to route each file's result
// correctly regardless of what order it was uploaded in.
//
// This does cost a little more per call than the two-separate-prompts
// version did (every call now carries both rule sets, not just the one that
// turned out to matter) - a fixed, modest, worthwhile trade for a bug class
// this is not: getting the whole import right no matter what order the
// files came in, rather than getting it cheaply and only when they came in
// the order the code silently assumed.
// A function of "today" rather than a plain constant: countdownEvents below
// needs a reference date so the model can resolve a year-less calendar date
// (e.g. a poster showing only "1/22", no year) to the correct year itself,
// instead of guessing one with no anchor at all - which in practice skewed
// toward whatever year the model's training data made it default to, often

{
  "documentKind": "timetable",
  "bellTimes": [],
  "breakTimes": [{"name":"午休","start":"12:00","end":"13:00"}],
  "classes": [{"key":"c1","subject":"國文","teacher":"陳老師","location":"A101"}, {"key":"c2","subject":"英文","teacher":"王老師","location":"B202"}],

  "reverseWeek": false,
  "courses": [{"subject":"多媒體音樂 I","teacher":"徐蓉莉","location":"","day":1,"periods":[3,4]}],
  "countdownEvents": [{"name":"116 學測","startDate":"2027-01-22","endDate":"2027-01-24"}]
}

First, set "documentKind" to exactly one of:
- "timetable" - the file shows a weekly class schedule grid: a table with days as one axis and periods as the other, each cell showing a subject (and often a teacher/room) for a whole week.
- "registration" - the file is a course-registration confirmation, enrollment list, or similar record: a list or table where each row names one specific course a student is actually taking, generally alongside which day and period(s) it meets. It does NOT show a full weekly grid.
- "other" - neither of the above (an unrelated photo, a notice with no course rows or grid, etc).

Then extract only the fields that match the documentKind you chose, and leave every other field at its empty default (empty array, empty object, or false) rather than guessing or leaving it inconsistent with documentKind. countdownEvents is the one exception - check for it regardless of documentKind, per its own rule below.

If documentKind is "timetable", fill in bellTimes/breakTimes/classes/weeklySchedule/reverseWeek (leave courses as an empty array):
- Read class period times from the image when available. Use 24-hour "HH:MM" strings, one entry per period in order, exactly as shown (either ["08:10","09:00"] or {"start":"08:10","end":"09:00"} is acceptable). Preserve the actual times; never invent, guess, or fall back to standard/default school times. If no class times are visible anywhere, return an empty bellTimes array.
- Identify visible subjects, teachers, classrooms, breaks, and other timetable information.
- classes: one entry per distinct subject actually visible in the photo — do not invent subjects that aren't shown. "key" is your own short identifier for that entry (e.g. "c1", "c2") — it is never shown to anyone, it only links weeklySchedule slots back to this entry, so make each one unique. "subject" is the full Chinese subject name. Use "" for teacher/location when that information is not readable.
- Every entry in classes MUST be placed at least once in weeklySchedule, at the exact day/period position where it visually appears in the grid. A subject you cannot place at a specific day and period is not a recognized class — leave it out of classes entirely rather than adding it unassigned. Do not stop at recognizing a subject's name; always also locate the cell(s) it occupies.
- weeklySchedule: keys "1" through "5" (Monday–Friday) are REQUIRED and must all be present, even as an empty array — never omit or truncate "5" (Friday) even if it is partially cut off in the photo. Add "6" (Saturday) and/or "0" (Sunday) ONLY if the photo actually shows a column for that day; otherwise omit them entirely. Keep each day's array aligned with the detected periods (one entry per bellTimes index). Use null when a slot is genuinely empty or cannot be identified — never fill a blank or unreadable cell by copying in a class from a different day or period just because a slot exists there; every non-null entry must be a "key" that exists in classes.
- If odd/even weeks contain alternatives in the same slot (shown as two stacked subject+teacher pairs, often marked 單/雙 or "odd/even"), read each alternative's subject and its own teacher as two separate pieces of text first, then combine same-role pieces with "/" — all subjects joined into one "/"-separated subject string, all teachers joined the same way into one "/"-separated teacher string, both in the same left-to-right order, as one shared classes entry for that slot. Never fold a teacher's name into the subject string, or vice versa: subject must end up containing only subject names, teacher only teacher names.
- Set reverseWeek to true only when the photo clearly indicates a reversed odd/even week orientation; otherwise false.
- Add breakTimes only for explicitly shown non-class periods such as lunch or cleaning — not empty/free periods.

If documentKind is "registration", fill in courses (leave bellTimes/breakTimes/classes/weeklySchedule empty, reverseWeek false):
- This kind of file's day/period information may be written out plainly, or packed together compactly — one shorthand seen often enough to call out explicitly: a single day character immediately followed by a run of digits with no separator, where each individual digit is its own period number (so a two-digit run like "34" means periods 3 AND 4, both occupied by that one row, never "period 34" or a "3 through 4" range). Whatever notation this file actually uses, decode it using the day-naming and period-numbering it establishes itself.
- courses: one entry per distinct course row actually shown — do not invent rows. "day" is an integer: 1 for Monday through 5 for Friday, 6 for Saturday, 0 for Sunday. "periods" is every period number that row's course occupies, as a plain array of integers in ascending order (e.g. a row spanning two consecutive periods is periods:[3,4], never a combined number like 34 or a string). Use "" for teacher/location when not given or not legible.

Regardless of documentKind:
- Add countdownEvents only for clearly visible events/exams with a readable calendar date, formatted as "YYYY-MM-DD". Set startDate and endDate to the same date for a single-day event; use the visible first and last dates for a multi-day event/exam period. Only include dates you can actually read the day and month of; otherwise return an empty array. A file can carry a countdown/exam notice with no timetable or course-list content at all (documentKind "other") - still report it.
- Today's date is ${todayIso}. If a countdown/exam date shows a day and month but no visible year, infer the year yourself so the resulting date is the nearest upcoming date on or after today: use this year unless that month/day has already passed this year, in which case use next year instead. Never infer a year that puts the event in the past. If a year is actually visible in the photo, always use that one instead, even if it looks like it's already past.
- Do not invent information. When uncertain, prefer an empty value, empty array, or null.
- Every field in the response schema you are given must be present, even when empty.
- Keep all fields internally consistent.
- Return ONLY the raw JSON object — no markdown fences, no comments, no extra text.`;

// demoted: confirmed live against the real API (not assumed from a
// changelog) that it now 404s for every caller - "no longer available to
// new users" - so keeping it in the fallback chain would only ever waste a
// retry.
//
// gemini-3.6-flash is gone too, for a worse reason: run against this
// feature's actual prompt+schema+multi-file request shape (not just
// pinged), it reproduced two separate real failures, not a one-off - a
// single-file request that burned through 24576 output tokens over 94
// seconds before finally coming back truncated and unusable, and a
// multi-file request that came back fast but recognized just 1 of 12
// classes. Both look like the same underlying problem: this model version
// misbehaving specifically under schema-constrained decoding. A fallback
// that can silently cost 94 seconds and still fail is worse than having no
// fallback there at all, since the retry loop below waits through the full
// thing before ever trying the next model.
//
// gemini-3.8-flash, the newest release, was tried as a replacement and
// rejected for a different reason: three attempts with backoff all came
// back 503 "high demand" - it simply isn't reliably available yet, not a
// correctness problem. Worth reconsidering once it's out of that state.
//
// That leaves two, both verified correct and reasonably fast on repeated
// single- and multi-file live runs.

// tokens on a markdown fence, a preamble, a trailing explanation or a

// about what belonged inside it) made the model leave the field empty far
// more often than not - nothing about an undescribed nested object signals
// "you are still expected to fill this in". An array of fully-typed objects
// has neither problem: it is legal to describe field-by-field, and it gives

The current data, given as read-only context so you know what already exists and can decide what to change - do NOT copy any of it back into your result, only refer to it by key/day/period:
${JSON.stringify(context)}

THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT RULE: this is a PATCH, not a copy of the schedule. List a class in "classUpserts" only if you are adding it or changing one of its fields; list a key in "deletedClassKeys" only if the instruction removes that class entirely; list an entry in "scheduleEdits" only for a (day, period) cell whose class actually changes. Never include a class, cell, break time, or countdown event just because it already exists - every one the instruction doesn't touch must be left out of the result entirely, never repeated back. This is also why "bellTimesChanged"/"breakTimesChanged"/"countdownEventsChanged"/"reverseWeekChanged" exist: leave the flag false (and its matching field empty/false) whenever the instruction doesn't touch that field at all; set the flag true, and only then fill in the field, when it does. The result is shown to the user as a diff against the current data before anything is saved, so anything you include here that the instruction didn't actually ask for shows up as a confusing, unwanted line in that diff.

Field shapes and meaning:
- "classUpserts": one entry per class being added or changed, as {key, subject, teacher, location} - all four fields are required on every entry you DO include (adding or changing a class replaces that whole entry, so if only the teacher changes, still repeat that same class's existing subject/location unchanged inside this one entry - never touch any other class just to do that). "key" is an internal id, not shown to the user - reuse a class's EXISTING key (from the context above) whenever you're changing that same course, even if you rename its subject/teacher/location, so "scheduleEdits" references to it stay valid. For a genuinely NEW course, invent a short new key not already used by any class in the context (e.g. "new1", "new2", ...); leave teacher/location as "" if the instruction didn't specify them. Defining a new course is a complete, valid request entirely on its own even when the instruction never says where to schedule it (e.g. "新增一個課程叫社團活動", "幫我建一個王老師教的數學課" with no day/period mentioned) - in that case just add it to "classUpserts" with a new key and leave "scheduleEdits" empty; never invent a day/period for it just because a course needs one eventually - the user places it into a slot themselves afterward.
- "deletedClassKeys": keys (from the context above) of classes the instruction removes entirely. Also add a "scheduleEdits" entry with "key": "" for every cell in the context that still references a deleted key, so nothing is left pointing at a class that no longer exists.
- "scheduleEdits": one entry per (day, period) cell whose class actually changes, as {day, period, key} - "key": "" clears that period (makes it free that day). Only list a cell here if the class it should now hold is different from what the context above already shows there. Moving a class is two entries (clear its old cell, set its new one); swapping two classes is two entries (each cell gets the other's key).
- "bellTimes"/"breakTimes"/"countdownEvents"/"reverseWeek": each has a matching *Changed boolean (see above). When the instruction adds, removes, or edits ANY period/break/event/the odd-even split, set that one flag true and give the COMPLETE new value of that whole field, in order (not a partial patch within it) - e.g. adding one bell period still means the complete "bellTimes" array including the new one; adding one break time still means the complete "breakTimes" array including the new one, and so on. "bellTimes" is the list of [start, end] 24-hour time strings ("HH:MM"), one per period, in the same order "scheduleEdits"' period numbers use. Adding a period means appending a new [start, end] pair; removing or reordering a period shifts every later period's index - when that happens, also add "scheduleEdits" entries for whatever classes sat in those later periods, moving each to its new index (and clearing its old one), so nothing silently ends up in the wrong period. "breakTimes" is named special/break times (e.g. 午休, 打掃時間, 就寢時間) as {name, start, end} - independent of "bellTimes"/the schedule, not tied to any period index. "countdownEvents" is named date-range events (e.g. 段考, 校慶) as {name, startDate, endDate} ("YYYY-MM-DD" each, the same day for a single-day event).

單雙週分堂課 (odd/even-week split classes): ONE class entry can alternate between two different subject/teacher pairs depending on whether the real-world week is 單週 (odd) or 雙週 (even) - this is a single "classUpserts" entry (never two, and never two "scheduleEdits" cells) whose "subject" and/or "teacher" string is written as "單週內容/雙週內容", the two halves joined by a "/" (a full-width "／" means the same thing - normalize it to "/"). Example: {"subject": "國文/公民", "teacher": "李老師/陳老師"} is one slot that shows 國文 taught by 李老師 on 單週 weeks and 公民 taught by 陳老師 on 雙週 weeks; "location" is never split this way, it's the same room either week. Recognizing, creating, and editing these:
  - An existing class already has this split if its subject or teacher (in the context above) contains "/". The part before "/" is what shows on 單週, the part after is 雙週.
  - To turn an existing single-subject class into a split one (e.g. "週三第二節國文，改成單週上國文、雙週上公民" or "幫我把這堂課弄成單雙週，雙週改成地理" where only one side is named and the other should stay what it already was), add ONE "classUpserts" entry reusing that class's existing key, joining the 單週 content and 雙週 content with "/" in whichever of subject/teacher actually alternates - leave the other field its existing plain unsplit value if it doesn't alternate (e.g. same teacher both weeks).
  - To create a brand-new split class from scratch (e.g. "新增一節課，單週英文王老師、雙週美術林老師"), it works exactly like creating any new course (see "classUpserts" above), just with "/"-joined subject/teacher instead of plain ones.
  - To edit only one side of an already-split class (e.g. "雙週那半改成地理" or "單週的公民老師換成陳老師"), the "classUpserts" entry's untouched side must repeat that side's text exactly as it already was in context, only the named side actually changes - this is still "only change what's asked", just scoped to half of one field inside one entry rather than the whole field.
  - To un-split one back into a single subject/teacher for every week (e.g. "OO老師的課取消單雙週，都固定上物理"), the "classUpserts" entry replaces the whole "/"-joined string with the one value that now applies always.

Day numbering: 0 = 週日, 1 = 週一, 2 = 週二, 3 = 週三, 4 = 週四, 5 = 週五, 6 = 週六 (matches JavaScript's Date.getDay(), the same numbering the context's own weeklySchedule keys use).
Period numbering: 0-based, matching the index into a weeklySchedule day array and into bellTimes (period 0 is 第一節, period 1 is 第二節, and so on).

The instruction to translate: "${text}"

Read the instruction the way a colleague would, not a compiler: it may be indirect, colloquial, or point at its target through context instead of naming it outright - e.g. "把國文課挪到早自習後面" means move it to whichever period immediately follows whatever's named/labeled 早自習 in the given context; "這兩堂對調" without the word "交換" still means swap them; "把雙週那半改掉" implicitly means the class in question already has a 單/雙週 split (see above) and only that half changes. Work out the concrete edit a reasonable teacher would mean from the wording and the context you were given, rather than requiring the instruction to spell out mechanics literally. This reasoning is about READING the instruction, not about inventing content: still never invent a day, period, subject, teacher, location, time, or event that neither the instruction nor the given context actually supports.

Decide "status":
- "ok": the instruction maps cleanly onto a change (or several - see below) to the data above, using only days/periods/classes/times that make sense given the context (and, for a multi-part instruction, given the effect of any earlier part already applied - e.g. moving a class out of a slot and then putting a different class into that now-empty slot is a perfectly ordinary two-part instruction, not a conflict). Fill in only whichever of "classUpserts"/"deletedClassKeys"/"scheduleEdits"/the four *Changed fields the patch actually needs - leave every other field/flag empty/false.
- "unclear": after actually reasoning through the wording and context as above, the instruction (or any part of it, if it describes several changes) still has multiple equally plausible readings with nothing to prefer one over another, is contradictory, or does not describe an edit to this data at all. This is not the same as "phrased indirectly" - reserve "unclear" for genuine ambiguity, not for instructions that merely require a little inference to resolve. Leave every field/flag empty/false (i.e. no actual change). Briefly explain why in "reason" (Traditional Chinese, one short sentence).
- "not_found": the instruction is clear about what it wants, but names a day, period, class, break time, or countdown event that does not exist in the given context at the point it's referenced. Leave every field/flag empty/false. Briefly explain in "reason" (Traditional Chinese, one short sentence).

A single instruction may describe more than one distinct change (e.g. joined by "而且"/"然後"/"，"/"、", or a numbered/bulleted list) - apply all of them together in the one result you return (e.g. several "scheduleEdits" entries, or a "classUpserts" entry alongside a "scheduleEdits" entry), same as if each had been requested separately in order. If any one part is ambiguous or refers to something that doesn't exist, treat the WHOLE instruction as "unclear"/"not_found" rather than silently applying only the parts that made sense.

// An on-demand feature from the sibling repo Orbit Vocab (see that repo's
// README/vocab-ai.js), genuinely needing a LIVE, per-request Gemini call
// rather than that repo's offline batch script
// (scripts/generate_ai_signals.py, which pre-generates one static
// confusedWith/mnemonic/priorDifficulty per word into data/ai_signals.json
// at build time): the request here depends on THIS learner's own data -
// their actual recorded wrong-answer history for one word - which a
// build-time batch job run once for every word in the vocabulary has no
// way to know.
//   - kind: "mnemonic" - one memory hook targeted at a specific word's
//     recorded wrong-answer pattern for THIS learner, not the generic
//     one-per-word hook data/ai_signals.json already ships offline.
// No passcode/identity check here (unlike /vocab-sync) - this isn't tied to
// any one learner's sync pairing, so it uses the same trust model /gemini
// already does: rate-limited by IP and gated by GEMINI_API_KEY, callable by
// anyone who knows the URL (CORS only stops a browser from a disallowed
// origin reading the response, not a direct request from reaching this
// far - see readGeminiFiles/cleanVocabAiText's own comments for why every
// field is still treated as untrusted input regardless). Its own rate-limit
// bucket ('vocab-ai', see isRateLimited's `feature` keying) means abuse here
// can never eat into /gemini's or /vocab-sync's own quota, and vice versa -
// same reasoning as every other route in this file.

// Reuses /gemini's own GEMINI_API_KEY secret (see handleGeminiRequest) -
// nothing new to configure once AI 辨識課表照片 is already set up. Not
// client-selectable (unlike /gemini's own `model` field): this feature has a
// small, fixed-shape request, so there's no multi-model fallback chain worth
// maintaining, just a single pick from GEMINI_ALLOWED_MODELS above. Picks
// the other one of the two rather than the lite model /gemini and /nl-edit
// use: those routes are bulk/structured extraction, where the lite model's
// speed matters and "thinking" buys nothing (see buildGenerationConfig).

// being generic and repetitive, not latency - so it trades a little speed
// for the stronger model's better creative writing.

// wrongAnswers is a small set of the SAME handful of common misspellings
// most learners actually make for a given word (e.g. "believe" -> "belive"

Name the specific letters; don't just gesture vaguely at "this part of the word".

Example of the right shape (a different word, "believe", where the learner dropped the second "e" and wrote "belive"): "『believe』中間藏著一個 lie（謊言）－ b-e-LIE-ve，你要先相信（believe）一個謊言（lie）才會被騙，所以中間是 l-i-e 兩個字母都不能少。"

Output ONLY the mnemonic itself. Do NOT open with a sentence naming or restating the mistake (e.g. "你把...拼成..."、"這個字你常把...搞混"、"正確拼法是...") - that's not a memory hook, it's just a description of an error the learner already knows about. Go straight into the technique.

Do NOT give generic study advice such as "多加練習"、"多寫幾次"、"多背幾次就會記住"、"注意拼法" or anything to that effect - if nothing else fits, invent a vivid image or sound association for the trickiest letters instead. Never restate the correct spelling on its own without a memory hook attached to it.`;

// ==== /sync - cross-device sync proxy =======================================
//
// Requires more setup than /gemini, because closing the gap properly means
// closing Firestore's direct, ruleset-gated door entirely - otherwise an
// abuser just skips this Worker and hits Firestore directly, same as
// before. That means:
//   1. This Worker authenticates to Firestore as a Google Cloud *service
//      account* (FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL / FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY below), not
//      as an anonymous client. Service-account access is treated the same
//      as the Admin SDK: it bypasses Firestore Security Rules entirely, by
//      design - the rules only ever gated unauthenticated client access.
//   2. Once this Worker is live, set the Firestore rule for
//      /orbit-schedules/{doc} to `allow read, write: if false`. That
//      closes the direct-client door completely - real, unauthenticated
//      public access - since actual devices now only ever reach this
//      Worker, and this Worker's own traffic to Firestore ignores that
//      rule anyway (see point 1). See README's cross-device sync section
//      for the exact rule text and the full one-time setup this needs.
//
// One shared sync code plus a separate manager passcode, with the passcode
// gating *only* write access - not two parallel codes:
//   - Creating a sync (POST, below) mints a plain sync code (the document's
//     own ID, same as the original single-code design) and a separate,
//     unrelated *manager passcode*, returning both to the caller once. Only
//     the passcode's SHA-256 hash is ever stored, as `managerPasscodeHash`
//     on the document, so a leak of the Firestore data itself can't be
//     turned back into a working passcode.
//   - GET (read/poll) never needs the passcode - anyone with the sync code
//     can read, exactly like the original design. Optionally supplying
//     `&passcode=` resolves whether that passcode is *this* document's
//     manager passcode (`role: 'manager'` in the response if so) - used at
//     join time and by an already-joined device unlocking manager mode
//     later, never by ordinary polling.
//   - PATCH (write) and DELETE both require the correct passcode - in the
//     JSON body for PATCH, as a query param for DELETE (which this app
//     never sends a body with). Missing or wrong passcode is a 403,
//     distinct from a nonexistent/mistyped code (its own message) - this is
//     the actual fix for what used to be true only by UI convention
//     (src/sync.js's applyEditorRoleLock): previously *any* holder of the
//     single code could PATCH or DELETE, because there was nothing else to
//     check.

// Must match the code/passcode format the client (and this Worker's own
// generateSyncCode below) produce - rejecting a malformed code here means
// it never even reaches Firestore, and the error message is the same
// either way. Passcodes reuse the exact same shape - they're just another
